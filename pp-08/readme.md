# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that object’s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral:  The odd shape and blackness of it look like something almost scary. It seems like it's something that will attack you when you're not looking.

* Behavioral: The curviness of the lamp makes it seem like it's maleable and controllable. It makes it seem like it could do whatever you want it do.

* Reflective: It's a good lamp that does it what you want it to do and offers a bright light. Still, the vicseral reaction makes be think they should've picked a nicer color other than black.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. Not black, offer a friendlier color.
2. Easy to use, maleable, and does it's job well.
3. Make the user believe that they are in control.
