## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=53W080kQNUJQNUJopNzXOsYN6oz
Your Rationale: I feel like this shade of blue gives of a sophisticated feel for a new gaming console for an older more mature generation. The richness of the blueness could also appeal to younger kids also perhaps. 

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=51U0n1ktIthtIthfPEPFmf8Qo34k8WuG00++0oU3p8kDLxcVk8WuG00++0oU3p8kDLxcV
Your Rationale: I think the yellow and white is a nice way to remind people to visit the garden again soon during the new hours. I was going to with green but I feel like green could just mean trees or grass and although humans are more naturally attracted to green, I still felt yellow was a better way to go for this.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=50B081kSyvgSyvgtBGzXBmlQkiwk8WuG00++0oU3p8kDLxcVk8WuG00++0oU3p8kDLxcV
Your Rationale: For this idea, I felt that orange went well because facebook messenger is blue, what's app is green and I feel this soft orange pallet exhibits a more serious and professional undertone which might appeal to some people looking for a more private messaging app.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=100080kEsudEsudmSvMPPmyG6hq
Your Rationale: I chose red because ruby on rails has a lot of Rs in it and to some reason I connect the two. I also feel like red is a striking and fun color so hopefully to make the course appeal as fun, I chose this color palette.
