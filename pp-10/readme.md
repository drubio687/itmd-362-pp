# Production Problem 10: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on a website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)
In the HTML would take away the navigation bar below the search bar. I would also get rid of a lot of the options, getting rid of excess links that are probably hardly ever used. I would take away the ad below it if I could. In the CSS I would center the title of the topics on the message board. I found the text just a bit too small so I would also increase the size of the text in the CSS. I would add some padding on each side that it looks more compact and easier to work with.
